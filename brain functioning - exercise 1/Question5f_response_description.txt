DESCRIPTION OF ERP RESPONSE IN CHANNEL 7:

1. FACES CONDITION:
   - The ERP shows a characteristic negative deflection (trough) around 1ms
   - Peak amplitude: 6.08 μV at 98ms
   - Trough amplitude: -10.52 μV at 520ms
   - This negative component is consistent with the N170 ERP component, which is 
     known to be particularly sensitive to face processing
   
2. FACES-AS-TEXTURE CONDITION:
   - Shows similar overall waveform but with reduced amplitude
   - The negative deflection is less pronounced compared to intact faces
   - This suggests that the scrambling/texturing of faces reduces the face-specific
     neural response
     
3. DIFFERENCE BETWEEN CONDITIONS:
   - The difference wave (Faces - Faces as Texture) shows that intact faces elicit
     a stronger negative response around 150-200ms post-stimulus
   - This differential response represents the face-specific processing that occurs
     in the N170 time window
   - The effect is most pronounced in the 150-200ms range, consistent with N170 literature
   
4. INTERPRETATION:
   - Channel 7 appears to be positioned over posterior regions (likely
     occipito-temporal areas) where face-sensitive N170 components are typically observed
   - The stronger response to intact faces vs. scrambled faces demonstrates that this
     ERP component is sensitive to face configuration, not just low-level visual features
   - The smoothing helped reveal the underlying ERP pattern by reducing high-frequency noise
