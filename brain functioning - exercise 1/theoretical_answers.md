## Question 1 (4 points)
### What neural signals are measured with EEG?

**EEG (Electroencephalography) measures:**

**Electrical Potentials:**
- EEG records **extracellular field potentials** - the electrical activity generated by the synchronized firing of large populations of neurons
- Specifically, it measures **postsynaptic potentials** (EPSPs and IPSPs) rather than action potentials
- These are relatively slow electrical changes that occur at the dendrites and cell bodies of pyramidal neurons

**Relevant Neurons:**
- Primarily **pyramidal neurons** in the cerebral cortex (layers 3-5)
- These neurons have long apical dendrites oriented perpendicular to the cortical surface
- The parallel orientation of these neurons allows their electrical fields to summate

**Brain Regions:**
- Mainly from the **cerebral cortex** (outer layers of the brain)
- Particularly from areas close to the scalp
- Signals from deeper structures (like hippocampus, thalamus) contribute weakly or not at all to scalp EEG

**Why we can measure postsynaptic potentials but not action potentials:**

1. **Duration:** Postsynaptic potentials last 10-100ms, while action potentials last only ~1ms. The longer duration allows for temporal summation.

2. **Synchronization:** Postsynaptic potentials can be synchronized across many neurons (thousands to millions), creating a strong enough signal to reach the scalp. Action potentials occur asynchronously and cancel out.

3. **Spatial configuration:** Postsynaptic potentials create open field configurations (dipoles) that extend to the scalp. Action potentials create closed fields that don't propagate far.

4. **Amplitude summation:** The slow time course of postsynaptic potentials allows signals from many aligned neurons to add together constructively. Fast action potentials from different neurons don't align temporally.

## Question 2 (4 points)
### Reference Montages: Monopolar vs. Average Reference

**MONOPOLAR REFERENCE:**

*Definition:* Each electrode's activity is measured relative to a single reference electrode placed at a theoretically neutral location (e.g., mastoid, earlobe, nose, or Cz).

*Advantage:*
- **Simplicity and interpretability:** Easy to understand - each channel shows activity relative to a fixed point. This makes it straightforward to interpret which brain regions are active.

*Disadvantage:*
- **No truly neutral reference:** There is no location on the head that is completely electrically inactive. The reference electrode picks up its own brain activity, which contaminates all channels. This means all recordings include the activity at the reference site as a negative component.

**AVERAGE REFERENCE:**

*Definition:* Each electrode is referenced to the average of all electrodes. The average signal across all channels is calculated and subtracted from each individual channel.

*Advantage:*
- **Reduced spatial bias:** By averaging all electrodes, the reference becomes more spatially distributed and less biased toward any single location. This can provide a more balanced view of brain activity across the entire scalp.

*Disadvantage:*
- **Assumes equal coverage:** The method assumes good, relatively uniform electrode coverage across the scalp. If electrodes are clustered in one area or if there's very strong focal activity, the average can be biased. Also, strong artifacts in any electrode will affect all channels.

## Question 3 (4 points)
### ERP Definitions and Oddball Task

**DEFINITIONS:**

**ERP Amplitude:**
- The magnitude or strength of an ERP component, typically measured in microvolts (μV)
- Can be measured as peak amplitude (maximum/minimum voltage) or mean amplitude over a time window
- Reflects the amount of neural activity associated with a specific cognitive process

**ERP Polarity:**
- The direction of the voltage deflection: positive or negative
- By convention, negative voltages are often plotted upward (though this varies)
- Different ERP components are defined partly by their polarity (e.g., P300 is positive, N170 is negative)

**ERP Latency:**
- The time delay between stimulus onset and the occurrence of an ERP component
- Typically measured in milliseconds (ms) from stimulus presentation
- Reflects the timing of neural processing; earlier components reflect sensory processing, later components reflect cognitive processing

**ODDBALL TASK - EXPECTED CHANGES:**

In an auditory oddball task with rare vs. frequent stimuli, we would expect:

1. **P300 Component:** The rare (oddball) stimulus will elicit a larger **P300** component compared to the frequent stimulus
   - **Increased amplitude** for rare stimuli (more positive deflection)
   - **Peak around 300-600ms** after stimulus onset
   - **Parietal scalp distribution** (maximum at Pz electrode)

2. **Earlier Components (N1, P2):** May also show amplitude differences, with rare stimuli potentially eliciting larger responses due to novelty

3. **Latency:** The P300 latency might be slightly longer for rare stimuli if they require more processing

The P300 reflects cognitive processes like attention allocation, working memory updating, and stimulus evaluation - all of which are engaged more strongly by unexpected/rare events.

### ERP Visualization and Interpretation

**a) Description of the ERP response:**

[Note: Since the actual figure wasn't provided in the text, I'll provide a general framework for how to describe an ERP]

The ERP should be described using directional and regional terminology:

- **Temporal characteristics:**
  - Early components (< 100ms): sensory processing
  - Middle components (100-300ms): perceptual and attention processes
  - Late components (> 300ms): cognitive processing
  
- **Spatial characteristics:**
  - Anterior vs. Posterior (front vs. back of head)
  - Left vs. Right hemisphere
  - Dorsal vs. Ventral (top vs. bottom)
  - Specific regions: frontal, central, parietal, occipital, temporal

- **Component characteristics:**
  - Positive or negative deflections
  - Peak latencies
  - Duration of components

**Example description format:**
"The ERP shows an early negative deflection (N1) at approximately 100ms post-stimulus, maximal over occipital electrodes, followed by a positive component (P2) at 200ms over central sites, and a late positive complex (P300) peaking at 400ms with a parietal distribution."

**b) Additional important information needed:**

To properly interpret this ERP response, we would need:

1. **Experimental context:**
   - What was the stimulus (visual, auditory, etc.)?
   - What was the task (passive viewing, target detection, decision-making)?
   - What condition does this ERP represent?

2. **Technical parameters:**
   - Sampling rate
   - Filter settings (high-pass, low-pass)
   - Reference scheme used
   - Number of trials averaged

3. **Comparison data:**
   - ERPs from other conditions in the same experiment
   - Control condition baseline
   - Expected ERP patterns from literature for similar paradigms

4. **Spatial information:**
   - Topographic maps showing the scalp distribution at peak latencies
   - Which electrodes show the strongest effects
   - Source localization if available

5. **Statistical information:**
   - Confidence intervals or standard error
   - Significance of observed components
   - Number of subjects/trials

6. **Individual variability:**
   - Is this a grand average across subjects or individual subject data?
   - Variability across participants
