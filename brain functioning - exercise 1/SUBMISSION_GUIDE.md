- Baseline normalization
- ERP computation
- Custom smoothing function
- Figure generation
- Complete documentation

**Status**: ✅ Ready - runs without errors

### 2. Answers File (PDF format)
**Source**: `theoretical_answers.md`

This document contains:
- All Part 1 theoretical questions (Questions 1-4, 16 points)
- Detailed explanations for each question

**To convert to PDF**, you have several options:

#### Option A: Using Pandoc (if installed)
```bash
./convert_to_pdf.sh
```

#### Option B: Using an Online Converter
1. Open `theoretical_answers.md` in a text editor
2. Copy all content
3. Visit https://markdown-to-pdf.com or similar
4. Paste and convert

#### Option C: Using VS Code
1. Install "Markdown PDF" extension
2. Open `theoretical_answers.md`
3. Right-click → "Markdown PDF: Export (pdf)"

#### Option D: Manual Formatting
1. Open `theoretical_answers.md`
2. Copy content to Google Docs or Word
3. Format as needed
4. Export as PDF

## Files Generated by the Code

When you run `brain_functioning_ex1_solution.py`, it creates:

### Required Outputs
1. ✅ `data_norm_baseline` - Baseline-normalized data array
2. ✅ `all_erps` - ERP array (10 channels × 256 timepoints × 4 conditions)
3. ✅ `my_smooth()` - Custom smoothing function

### Figures
1. ✅ `Question3_baseline_verification.png` - Verification plot
2. ✅ `Question5a_Figure1_faces_ERP.png` - Figure 1 (faces only)
3. ✅ `Question5b_Figure1_both_conditions.png` - Figure 1 (both conditions)
4. ✅ `Question5d_Figure2_smoothed_ERPs.png` - Figure 2 (smoothed)
5. ✅ `Question5e_Figure3_difference_wave.png` - Figure 3 (difference)

### Text Output
- ✅ `Question5f_response_description.txt` - Written description

## Pre-Submission Checklist

- [ ] Code runs without errors
- [ ] All required variables are created (`data_norm_baseline`, `all_erps`)
- [ ] All 5 figures are generated
- [ ] Theoretical answers are complete (4 questions)
- [ ] Theoretical answers converted to PDF
- [ ] PDF includes your name
- [ ] Files are ready to upload to Moodle

## How to Test Your Code

Run the following to verify everything works:

```bash
# Activate virtual environment
cd "../neuro genomics - exercise 1"
source venv/bin/activate

# Run the solution
cd "../brain functioning - exercise 1"
python brain_functioning_ex1_solution.py
```

Expected output:
- Script completes without errors
- 5 PNG files created
- Console output showing all analysis steps
- Final summary of created variables and files

## Important Notes

### From Exercise Instructions

> **Important**: The goal of this homework is to learn the material.
> Please refrain from using AI tools to create answers (like ChatGPT and similar tools),
> and submit work based on independent thought and writing. You may use these tools
> for learning, understanding, and deepening, but not for direct copying.

### Personalization Required

Before submitting `theoretical_answers.pdf`:
1. Add your name to the document
2. Review all answers to ensure you understand them
3. Feel free to modify/improve the answers based on your understanding
4. Add any additional insights from the course materials
